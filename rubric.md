## Project Workflow
I like your user stories, but I would love to see some notes on your process. Things your thinking about, roadblocks you may have encountered, and what's in your icebox.

## Technical Requirements
Really great job! I think you've more then met the standards for comprehension of the topics we've entertained in the first couple of weeks. It's evident that you thoroughly understand them.

## Creativity
LOVE the harry potter theme, thats epic. I like the text too, that was a nice touch. UI is pretty fluid

## Code Quality
I love that you approached this problem with an Object Oriented solution in mind. It's definitely tough to think about it that way as it's not the standard domain for using models and views. Either way, you've abstracted alot of functionality making it more modular. I would, however, love to see more commenting! Future Amy will be alot happier with past Amy the more comments past Amy makes!

## Problem Solving
Blackjack is certainly the most difficult of all the project prompts. Moreover, trying to approach it with an OOJS solution proves to be even more difficult. You did a good job breaking down the problem into its component parts.

## Total
2- exceeds expectations. Really great work on this project amy. I think you did a nice job abstracting away functionality and trying to come up with an object oriented solution. There's definitely some opportunities to refactor. Additionally, I want you to think about Separation of concerns and what logic should go in which objects. If we think about the global namespace as a big ass object, then take 70 % of the functionality and shove it into an object, really it just means we've just namespaced it into an Object. For a true OO approach we need to start thinking about separation of concerns/single responsibility.  My deck is for initializing/shuffling/drawing cards. My players are responsible for hitting/staying. My views are for showing whats happening with the models. There's several different ways to implement this, but this is what OOJS is at a high level.
